<b>From Compassionate Care to Code:</b> <br/>
Driven by a passion for helping others, I'm transitioning from the fulfilling world of nursing to the exciting realm of software engineering. As a first-generation American, I'm fueled by the desire to make a positive impact, and I see code as a powerful tool to do just that.
<br/>
Currently based in the Tampa area, I bring a unique blend of empathy and analytical thinking to the table. My nursing background instilled in me a deep understanding of human needs, while my growing tech skills equip me to translate them into innovative solutions.
<br/>
Whether it's crafting user-friendly interfaces or developing life-changing healthcare applications, I'm eager to leverage technology to empower others and make a real difference.
